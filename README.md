# Snippets

This is a collection of reusable code that I (Tjabalooo) have written. The main reason to keep this in a public repo is to be able to find it when I need it. The second reason is that keeping it public makes it easier to use as part of my portfolio. The third reason, but so not the smallest one, is that I want to share what I create with the community.
